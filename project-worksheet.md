### MVP User Stories

MVP:

- On load, a user will be prompted to input their location via interaction with an autocomplete location form.

- This location input will be passed to the Open Weather API to gather local weather forecast data.

- The user will have several options for ride planning timeframes:

- Ride Soon: Will utilize hourly forecast data to show weather condition expectations for the next 6 hours.

- Ride Later: Will utilize hourly forecast data to show weather conditions for the next 48 hours.

- Ride This Week: Will utilize daily forecast data to show weather conditions for the next week.

Stretch Goals:

- Incorporate a unique visualization scheme to help better communicate time windows with ideal riding conditions.

- Incorporate automated location data capture with user permission to improve UX beyond direct user input.
